Project Name : Integrating Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process in an E-Commerce Web Application.
Installation Instructions
1.Restore the NuGet Packages.
2.Create an Initial Migration.
3.Update the Database.
4.Fix the connection strings and the configuration to your desire
5.Run the ETL database script on a new database called ETLDatabase or create a migration for it as well
6.Run the application.

If you want to run the application with Data my best recommendation is to change the 
Northwind script to not include the table creation. Then do pretty much the same steps as previously mentioned.

I don't really know if the shared resources reference gets saved, but the initial resources were described in the dissertation document chapter 5.
ETL references commondata , individual references ETL and CommonData, ETL unit tests reference ETL. 

Another solution that you could also try and should work is run the Northwind Sql SCript included, 
create a new Migration. Keep only the changes done to the inital schema and the identity tables the changes are also documented 
inside of the dissertation chapter 3. After succesfully updating the database and ensuring the modelbuilder is correct (along with dbcontext)
you can run the application.
Either way the easiest way to run the application is without data, just by configuring both connection strings 
and db connections, updating the database and running the application.
